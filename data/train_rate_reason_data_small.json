[{"story": "SV-2.<br><br>My life never deviated from this cycle from as early as I could remember. Ever waking moment, I spent in some strange chamber or tank of sorts. In it, I was suspended in a murky, viscious liquid.<br><br>I felt nothing aside from a faint tickle- barely perceptible- in and around mouth, which I assume was the tubing used to feed me, or supply me with oxygen, or remove my waste. I wasn't sure.<br><br>I heard nothing aside from a constant whirling of machinery and hum of electricity. I've heard that drone for so long, I found myself often unable to recognize it; the ringing produced from the stirring of my eardrums against the liquid was always louder.<br><br>I kept track of my day by what I tasted and smelled. There'd always be a different caustic, synthetic smell and taste that shot across the back of my throat at different points during the day. I didn't know what was entering my body, but it was the same pattern each day. The first: a burning, poignant scent, the second: a metallic, saline one, and finally, much later, an extremely bitter one. The final one numbed me to the point of near-unconsciousness. It was a sleep-like state, but my mind was still present; clouded and dampened, but present.<br><br> I'd have the erratic and disturbing dreams in this state. They were twisted, blurry images flashing in rapid succession. Sometimes it was just a pattern of lights. Other times it was images of random objects. However, most often it was images of contorted, malformed figures appearing to be shuddering or screaming amid an episode of hysteria. But I couldn't tell if they were truly screaming. The dreams were silent and evanescent, most of the content slipping from my mind when all of my facilities returned to me.<br><br>Hardly coincidentally, every time after the end of such a dream, my head would be raised from beneath the liquid for a very brief moment of solace from the isolation. It would be raised to see a bare room, evenly lit with blaring, white lights. In my line of vision, the room appeared to be empty, aside from an alphanumeric combination stenciled onto the wall:<br><br>SV-2.<br><br>That was the highlight of my day. Then I would be submerged again, and it was as if I had never been apart from the darkness and isolation in the first place. I have a strong feeling my life used to be different, but this is all there was now, and I couldn't even begin to imagine anything else.<br>And today would be the same. It began with poignant scent, as usual. I knew what would be nex-<br><br>I suddenly grew incredibly dizzy.<br>I blinked.<br>I wasn't in my tank anymore.<br>\"It worked.\" I heard a raspy voice say. I looked around the dimly lit room, still dizzy. A small group of people were sitting around me, a man with a shaved head in front of me.<br>\"Ma'am?\" He said as he looked in my eyes. I tried to vocalize. All that manifest was a hoarse groan. The timbre of my voice was that of a young woman. It didn't seem like mine.<br>\"They had her under this whole time,\" A deeper voice somewhere to my right began, \"Give her a kick.\"<br>The shaved man turned away from and left my sight. I tried to follow him with my eyes, but my neck didn't rotate at all. My body wasn't moving. The man quickly returned with a needle filled with a pitch-black liquid and jabbed it straight into my arm, pouring its contents into my vein. It brought a bitter smell to my nose, but immediately, my dizziness vanished, and after a violent rush of chills across my body, I felt I could move it again.<br>\"Ma'am,\" He said as he bowed his head ever so slightly, \"How do you feel? Do you know who I am?\"<br>I looked around again. Everyone in the room stared at me intensely, as if they awaited my answer. \"I... have a headache. What's happening?\"<br>Everyone exchanged apprehensive glances. \"Our newest member, Rosaline, has the ability to switch bodies with someone she... has an approximate location of. She just used it on you. You are currently in her body.\" I didn't respond. I didn't understand what he was saying.<br>\"What?\" I barked. There was a pause.<br>\"Ma'am, do you remember anything before your imprisonment?\" He asked. I was imprisoned?<br>\"What the hell are you talking about? Imprisonment?\"<br>Everyone looked around again. \"Ma'am, it seems they've chemically induced amnesia on you. I suspect it'll be temporary, but allow me to explain. We know you as Prima. You were the second human to develop extrasomatic abilities. You founded an organization to protect those with such abilities from the 'regulation' of the so-called Heroes Agency. They have abilities as well. And they use them to control which abilities are existent, by killing whoever possess one they deem too dangerous. And they control how many ability users there are, by limiting child birth. They openly kill anyone in opposition to them, and imprison most ability users the same. They captured you, Ma'am. We've just retrieved you.\"<br><br>I didn't know if I believed him, \"If I'm your leader, why didn't they kill me?\"<br>\"They were harnessing your ability.\"<br>\"And so what's my ability then?\"<br>\"Ma'am... The contents of dreams create new abilities for you to use. Though, in order to activate the new ability, you must bestow it on another as well. You gave me mine... Pyrokinesis. You gave Thelsef his... Flight. You built us. They were forcing you to dream and increasing their ranks, we believe.\"<br>I didn't know what to say, \"I don't- I don't think I want to be part of thi-\"<br>The man rose quickly and pulled something from his pocket. An old photograph. \"You are a part of this. Remember?\"<br>I looked at the picture. A middle aged woma- No, it was me. The person in the picture was me. By my side was a old, stocky, and well-dressed man wearing an awkward smile, and a young girl with her faced turned away from the camera, it being buried in my legs in some silly position. There was something about the girls hairstyle, her two sloppily composed, loose braids. My throat began to close and tears rushed to my eyes. I didn't know who she was, but seeing her brought me pain.<br>\"The man- That's the first ability user. The girl, that's the third.\" The man said slowly.<br>My voice cracked, \"Wh-Who-\"<br>\"They killed them both. Your father, your daughter. You are a part of this.\"<br><br>I couldn't speak. I couldn't remember anything aside from feelings. I remembered my hatred. I remembered how much I never wanted that to happen again. I remembered how much I wanted to see the Heroes agency fall. I remembered the feelings.<br><br>Something dark stirred deep within my chest and my body began to tremble. Strong visions of eldritch energies began to flash across my mind. I felt waves and waves of chills ripple across my body and sparks of peculiar sensations gripping my bones.<br><br>I remembered my power.<br><br>I remember how to use it.<br><br>\"Ma'am?\"<br><br>\"I...\" I stood up, \"We're all part of this.

Bruce was the most tolerable when I just ignored him. I didn\u2019t want to be in the Cleansing Squad, but the Tribunal assigned me to work as a Squad Consultant to make sure none of the debris was dangerous. <br><br>Bruce signaled for a huddle. We circled around him. \u201cListen kids. Here\u2019s the plan. We\u2019ve got a team of dissenters assembling in the city. These fuckers are smart. Tribune said they are workin\u2019 to fix up some shit that didn\u2019t get cleansed. Tribune don\u2019t want that obviously. We could face some bad stuff in there, so here\u2019s the plan: Stick together, and use the alley, their camp is \u2018bout a half mile inside.

I gripped my sword tightly. My stomach tingled from looking so far up. Our Squad was considered one of the best, so we had the best issued weapons. Hell. Bruce got two swords. Most squads had knives or spears. We even had 3 bows. The Cleansing had destroyed most of the weapons. Humanity cannot be trusted with the ability to kill on demand. The only thing stopping us from killing is making it inconvenient. <br><br>\u201cShit!\u201d Bruce whispered. My head snapped back to the ground as I watched Bruce gut an enemy guard. I saw another coming from his right. I saw the body fall, an arrow nestled in its skull. I shuddered. I wasn\u2019t a real soldier. Sometimes I even thought humanity had a chance. <br><br>The guards had a star covered insignia on their breast pocket. They were from Amer. For years we\u2019ve been fighting to Cleanse their advancements. <br><br>I heard a noise behind me and quickly turned to see our flankers easily take down five more guards. As I was turning back around I saw a flash from the roof. An Amer had jumped onto our last guard, severing his neck on the way down. Thud. Another arrow. We kept going. Death is inevitable. <br><br>We made it to the camp without further incident. It was worse than we expected. Crates loaded with bangsticks. Kegs and kegs of \u2018Plosive. \u201cINTRET\u201d Bruce roared. \u201cItemize this shit and let\u2019s burn it down.\u201d I almost thought I heard fear in his voice, but he was probably just hoarse. <br><br>I checked off my clipboard and moved as fast as I could. Bruce was getting antsy. I hated it when he paced. \u201cAll done!\u201d I shouted, trying to sound confident, or at least reassuring. But my voice sounded pretty airy when it came out. Bruce lit his torch and ordered us to march. I was second to last, with Bruce bringing up the rear. Something felt off. It was too easy. So many weapons, so few guards. Then I saw it. The fuse. The powder. The trap. \u201cBruce wait!\u201d I yelled. This time not feeble. <br><br>\u201cShut the fuck up Intret, this isn\u2019t a damn sightseeing expedition.\u201d He replied as he dropped the torch and ran up to us. <br><br>The sound was awful. Every loud noise imaginable engulfed me until I could no longer hear. I couldn\u2019t see because of the smoke. I couldn\u2019t tell if my ears were ringing or my brain was imploding. <br><br>I came to under the shadow of the tall building. Bruce was next to me. The others couldn\u2019t have survived. Bruce coughed than sat up. The Amer general stood over us, holding his bangstick. <br><br>\u201cWhy do you keep trying? When does the futility set in? Can you not see what attacking does? He asked with a controlled anger. Bruce didn\u2019t move. \u201cHow can we come to peace if the only desire is weapons? This is why the Cleansing took place; to stop this violence. Look at yourself. All you want is power.\u201d. I answered. He smiled back at me. \u201cHow are you any different young soldier? Here you are, attacking us, and you accuse us of violence? How na\u00efve of you. Humans were meant to fight. We only survive on the blood of others. Look at the ruins before us. They were built with the spoils of war. Now look at us. Naked, hiding in the woods. We used to be great. The leaders of old were nothing more than scared children. Hiding their toys so their friends did not break them.\u201d He paused, looking toward the ceiling. \u201cWe love to kill. We will always kill. Why do it so crudely? I am only accelerating the inevitable.\u201d His smile faded \u201cWhat a stimulating conversation, but I\u2019m afraid I have places to be\u201d He lowered his weapon, and fired.<br><br>For the second time today, I was alive when I thought I was dead. Bruce had jumped forward, taking the bullet and slitting the general\u2019s throat with one last powerful swipe. I crawled over. \u201cBruce, why would you do this?\u201d <br><br>\u201cIntret. I been livin\u2019 like this a while now. It ain\u2019t right. We point fingers at them Amers. But we do the same damn shit. The only difference is our flags. They want peace through fear, we want to keep peace through fighting. None of it makes good sense. I\u2019m tired of thinkin\u2019 bout it. I\u2019m a man of killing. I was raised to fight. I can\u2019t stop. You, well. You\u2019re different. Sometimes you think there is good in this world. I finally think you\u2019re right. You spend time looking at all this broken shit, and old rubble, and it makes sense to you. You understand it. Hell. The future lies in the past.\u201d He coughed up blood on my arm.

Your Honor.\" he hastily added that last part. I could see, he had no respect for this judge, or the court, but he knew how to play a game with a contract. He looked over at me and smiled with pointy teeth. He knew he had a contractual right to me, but what he didn't know is that each of my parents had promised me to another in exchange for gifts. Of course, neither of them thought their gift should include not dying in childbirth, or a week later in a car crash. So I was an orphan at a week old. I was raised by my grandparents who knew nothing about any bargain by either their daughter, or their almost-Son-in -Law. <br><br>\"Did you attempt to claim your *property* on their 16th birthday?\" Judge Zipp asked slowly pausing over the word 'property'. She was a family law expert, and this particular case bothered her on many levels. One, was that prior to this trial, she knew nothing of the existence of the supernatural world. That would be big enough for many, but the others were that people would promise a child to a goblin and a demon separately and all that entails. She looked at me with the understanding that she would use the law to help ME remain free.<br><br>\"Well, there was an irregularity in her location notifications. I didn't know where young Ally was, so I could not claim her. There's nothing in the contract that states it has to be ON her birthday, just that she becomes mine on that date.\" The goblin seemed satisfied in his answer.<br><br>\"Ahem...\" The demon on the other side of the room made his presence known. He looked like something out of a renaissance painting depicting the Devil, red skin, horns and all. <br><br>\"Would you like to object to his testimony?\", the judge asked. She wasn't sure if he didn't know the protocol, or if he was just feeling above it.<br><br>\"Oh, I object to this entire proceeding. But, I'm patient. You see, She was promised to me at birth, I chose not to collect, at that time, because, let's face it. Children are a pain to raise correctly.\" There was nodding among the various demons sitting behind him as well as some of the goblins and other magical folks. They all stopped nodding when the judge scanned the room.<br><br>\"As I was saying, She's mine, she's always been mine, and since you chose not to make the effort to claim her on her 16th birthday, you have forfeit any claim you may have had at one point. Besides, your contract was with the father.

Well, some of the boys in class freaked out and started to throw things at him. He then loudly proclaimed to my RA in my dormatory that I was moving out and they were to pay him in GOLD for my leftover room and board fees. He showed them the contract, then showed it to the POLICE when they showed up. They escorted him off campus, then I received this summons in the mail to be in court.\" I shrugged. \"Oh, and I have no idea who that demon is at the other table.\"<br><br>\"That demon, would be I, Gnorblad. I would use my full name, but it might shatter glass in the windows. Your mother made a deal with me a long time ago. So long ago, she didn't even remember making it. The Babysitter was to have her harmed for nonpayment. I intervened on her behalf, she was only 6 weeks old, and just a dear at the time. I got her mother on the right track, but the bargain had been set. You, are mine.\" He pulled out a simple 1 page contract with a fingerprint on it. We knew it was in blood.<br><br>The judge read over the contract. She tapped the side of her head with a pencil for a moment. In my chambers, you and you. She was pointing at me and Gnorblad the demon. <br><br>\"YOU CANNOT LEAVE ME OUT OF THIS!\" the goblin screamed. The judge flung the gavel like Molinjor at goblin who couldn't avoid the hit to his nose. The instant it struck, he burst into flames. \"Arrrrrhg!\" and within seconds, he was only ash. a second after his flames died, a single hot ash landed on the contract he held with my father causing it to erupt in flames as well. The Bailiff waited until it was completely consumed before hitting it with the fire extinguisher. <br><br>\"Got it, it's out, we're all safe now!\" he proclaimed. Judge Zipp rolled her eyes. <br><br>All the mythical creatures behind the goblin stared in horror. \"What did she do?\" they asked.<br><br>\"This is my courtroom. That was my right, do you understand?\" She held her hand out and the gavel returned to it like she was lady Thor. The assembled goblins, elves and other fae folk slowly got up and left the room. That was that.<br><br>\"Ok Gnorblad, what am I going to do with you?\" <br><br>Gnorblad looked down at his paper and smiled. \"Nothing your Honor. I knew about the boy's deal with the goblin. He actually didn't die in a car crash. That's what your father got out of the deal, a 'tabula rasa'. Clean slate.\" he shrugged and pulled out a pen. \"Your Honor, can you witness that I am writing here that young Ally belongs to herself until such time as she chooses to give herself to another?\" he wrote on the paper, then handed it to the Judge who held it cautiously.<br><br>\"Can't we just tear this up?\" I asked. \"I mean, what were you going to do with me?\"<br><br>\"Oh, just because I look like this and should be pushing the \"penis cart\" doesn't mean I'm some completely evil thing.

She enjoyed conducting her dating interviews at the office where she worked, and made a spectacular event of each one. She would lead them in with a blank expression on her face and quiz them on their resume. Sometimes, she would test them - give them small jobs that she would expect her boyfriend to do. These things usually involved doing her mundane dayjob duties for her.<br><br>No matter what, though, the men would always leave disappointed.

He simply entered the workspace, hooting and hollering, making a grand entrance. A young black male, approximately mid twenties. Rocawear t-shirt, baggy slate jeans, neon Nike sneakers, wearing a gold chain and stunner shades. His hair was a wild mess of dredlocks, and he proudly sported a permanent grin on his face. I immediately thought that he would be rejected before the interview even began, but life is apparently full of surprises.<br><br>The man introduced himself - to everyone - as Deshawn. He passed out copies of his mixtape to everyone in the general vicinity, which he described as \"straight fire\". Finally, when Reina went to introduce herself, gesturing for a handshake, she was caught off-guard with a thug-hug and a vigorous pat on the back. Just when I thought it couldn't possibly get any worse, he handed her his resume - but wait - not a traditional resume. It was far too small. A business card?<br><br>Reina took the slip of paper from the man and stared at it intensely. I could see a fire burning in her eyes, hot enough to bore though the paper and into the man's very soul itself. For a solid minute she looked at it. Studied it. Gazed upon the words written. For once in her life, she looked passed the superficial things, like what kind of typeset he was using, or how he indented his paragraphs, or what kind of professional references he bothered to write down.<br><br>Reina looked up from the paper and stared into the eyes of the man standing before her, still smiling like an idiot.

Ah, fuck it, they won't know the difference.\" I finished my drink and walked back over behind the counter to grab the bottle of whiskey. Recently this kind of alcohol found its way into my glass more and more often. I guess it reminded me a lot of Uncle's homebrew. Been feeling pretty homesick as of late, however, I don't really understand why. Fucking hated the place but I suppose it's just human nature to miss where you came from. \"Just like it's human nature to live forever!\" Shut up. I poured the drink into my warm glass. It's a slow day so I figured I'd keep myself occupied with drinking and inventory selection. I was thinking the shop's been looking a little too unappealing as of late. \"I've gotta attract some more idiots. But how?\" Could get those rock lamps, might give a nice look plus I've wanted an excuse to get one! \"As soon as I pay that bill, I'll order some!\" I went to take a sip when all the sudden the door opened. Startled me enough to drop my drink and fall underneath the counter when I try to catch it.<br><br>\"Shit!\" I wasn't really worried about myself as much as I was the drink. \"Wasted....\" I whispered.<br><br>\"Hello? I heard a noise, is anyone here?\" The voice was light and fluttering and apparently didn't seem to give a damn that she might be responsible for one less drink. That or she's clueless and just didn't think anything even happened. \"Is this shop open right now?\" I'm gonna go with the latter.<br><br>\"Hello?\" It became louder and somehow more annoying.<br><br>\"Yes! Yes, I am here!\" I struggled to get up and waved towards the door. \"You know, just because this place has some skulls doesn't mean you can try to startle the owner to death.\"<br><br>\"Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.\" She apologized, earnestly but it still had that naive flutter to it.<br><br>The lights around the door were off. Figured it would be more spooky, Halloween being around the corner and all. I could just see a figure with a handbag around her arm. Didn't really make out anything else. \"Yeah? Tell that to my drink.\" I gruntled and started to grab a broom.<br><br>She took a step forward but the light still didn't reach her perky smile that I could tell she had. \"I just walk by this place sometimes and I thought I should come and check it out. Think I could have a look around, if it's not too much trouble.\"<br><br>I got the broom and started walking back to the counter. \"Yeah, whatever. Just don't break anything.\"<br><br>Her shadowed figure jumped a little in annoying excitement. \"Awesome! Can you help me look around?\"<br><br>Really? It's not even that big of a store. \"Yeah sure, just let me clean up this mess first.\"<br><br>\"No problem!\" She started to look around to the side of the store. Being a clever entrepreneur that I am, I've really created a nice atmosphere to go with the store. Really drives the point of 'tread carefully where demons roam' tagline I got going. So, naturally, this ditz bumped into ev-ery-thing!<br><br>\"Hey, be careful over there.

I went to the dimmer and set it up 20%. \"Better, your Majesty?\" I turned and she was looking at the shelves facing the window.<br><br>\"Yeah, thank you!\" She looked back slightly but went back to her perusing. I put the broom up and clean my hands before making my way to her.<br><br>\"So anything interesting to you?\" I was still wiping off some dust from my coat.<br><br>\"Yeah, that urn up there. What are those strange patterns?\" I looked up at the shelf to see the object she's talking about. The urn was sitting at the top of the shelf, covered by the outer edge of the curtain that surrounds the window. It was an object I try to forget but still keep around. But...\"Why is it glowing?\"<br><br>\"It's not supposed to?\"<br><br>\"No...\"<br><br>\"Why not? Someone else put the glow in the dark paint while you weren't looking?\"<br><br>\"Excuse me?\" I turned slightly but didn't look since I was busy getting my stool to grab the urn. \"That urn is special to me and besides, are you implying that the objects here are fake in any fashion?\" First my drink and now my reputation. Yep, I hate her.<br><br>\"I figured that most of this stuff is fake and I wanted to come in to see if I could figure out which ones were. A fun little game I guess!\"<br><br>\"Well good luck because it's genuine as it gets. Maybe if you had a eye for the supernat..\" Who the hell is that?! I fell having this thought and felt all my wares falling with me. A shelf had a loose screw that I didn't see when I was looking down at this person. This woman. Who IS she? <br><br>I fell hard. Books, plastic flasks, my paper mache skull I made that one time I got really plastered. Everything. I looked for the urn only to see it was still falling and about to cover the floor with some very real glass. I reached out but quickly realized I wouldn't grab it. As I braced, her arms stretched out to catch the urn perfectly.<br><br>It was over. I quickly stood up to check the urn in her hands. \"Stupid, stupid!\" Over 300 years, I've protected that thing for Patty and I almost lost it because I can't fucking stop drinking. I almost forgot my promise. \"Thank you, thank you so much! This thing is incredibly important to me! I thank you for grabbing it!\" I looked up and felt something that is long lost to me. My heart stopping.<br><br>\"You're so welcome, but are you OK? You took a hard fall with all that stuff. I'm surprised you didnt get hurt so much...\"<br><br>I couldn't bring out my voice. \"It's....it's.... they're fake......\"<br><br>\"Ah ha! I knew it, you're a fake! Well I'm sorry it took breaking your store but at least I know now!\" She gleefully smiled at me but not in an inflammatory way. More in jest. \"What else is joke stuff?\"<br><br>\"Joke stuff....do you not.....\" I tried to compose myself but, honestly, how could I? \"Do you remember me?\"<br><br>\"Remember you? Like your store? Like I told you when I came in, I've never been in this store. But it's on my way so you may have seen me!\"<br><br>\"No, I mean. Remember me, it's Walter Corely.\"<br><br>\"Walter? Never met you before. My name is Stacey though! Stacey Bennett.\"<br><br>\"No, your name is Patty....Patricia. Patricia Langston. The strongest, smartest woman I had ever met!\"<br><br>\"Alright dude, you're creeping me out... I'm not trying to ruin your business or anything. This was just for my curiosity.\"<br><br>\"I'm sorry, holy crap.\" But how is she here? No, it can't be her. Could it? What the hell was in that drink?! \"I'm sorry, I thought you were someone else.\" I stared at the urn. The urn Patty gave me, the urn SHE gave me. It has had patterns of rose thorns wrapping around it but now has glowing outlines. Faint, but sure as hell not there before.<br><br>\"Oookkkaaayy...so anyways are you sure you're ok? Because I still have questions about this urn. Fake or not, might look cool in my flat. If I can keep my cat from knocking it over, that is.\" She giggled. Just like how Patty did. Her voice was in a much different tone but seeing her face now, it was clear this was her. It's clear now that she wasn't crazy back then.<br><br>\"You want to buy the urn?\"<br><br>\"Yeah. Are you gonna say it's cursed or something because credibility is fading fast man.\"<br><br>\"The urn is a soul capture device. As it was explained to me, at the end of a witch or warlock's life they can shove their soul in the urn and lock it away until it is ready for resurrection.\"<br><br>\"So it's a way to live forever?\"<br><br>\"Not exactly, the magic arts have much more..... efficient ways to do that. The urn is a spiritually timed device. You don't get to choose when you are reincarnated and if it breaks or is damaged sufficiently, you are dead forever.\"<br><br>\"That's hella creepy. So who's was it? Why are you keeping it?\" I looked her in her hazel eyes, the same eyes I saw when they closed before performing the ritual for the urn.<br><br>\"It was my love's. She fell ill many years ago.\"<br><br>\"Oh, I'm sorry! I can't take this from you if it's important to you!\" At that moment I realized that the wait might have been for something.<br><br>\"No, take it. I understand the glowing now. It means the soul has been revived. It worked.\"<br><br>\"Huh, really?\"<br><br>\"Yep, all yours.\" I walked over to the counter.<br><br>\"Dunno, sounds like you're just making a sale.\"<br><br>\"Hey, either way it's good for me.\"<br><br>\"Fair enough.

Another mission complete. Number 34- this one was a contractor who had chickened out of my client\u2019s deal and wanted to expose his doings. I was contacted three days to take him out. The task was simple enough for me. They knew where he lived, what his habits were, family and all that. They always do know things before they even offer you a business deal.

And there was something I was really looking forward to. I had found this quiz the other day, \u201cHow Psychopathic Are You?\u201d. Needless to say, I was intrigued. The contracts had been less frequent lately as the elections were coming up and gore was to be kept to a low. This was where the money was going to come into play and murders were to avoided as much as possible. This left me with plenty of free time and I had to find new interests. I\u2019m not much of a social guy so I had begun to dive into the rabbit hole of internet- Reddit and all that. <br><br>Anyways, I reached home, took a bath and made me some coffee. Booted my laptop and searched for the quiz. It showed up on the very top- must be crazy popular. The quiz had a variety of questions ranging from psychology ones to even religion. I was impressed. Whoever made it had done quite some research. Or so I thought. As I hit submit after the last question, I was hit by a wave of expectation.

I hit a dead end and grew desperate. I thought and thought. There was only one person now who could get me something on her and make sense of this mess. <br><br>I contacted Sojiro. It was obviously an alias. No one knew his real name and he was the best of the best. You went to him when you had exhausted all your options or you had a task big enough which could justify his price. I had nothing to give to him in return and it had now become a big task. This DreamGirl779 was a powerful woman who knew what she was doing. An assassin, on top of it all. The call connected, being pinged off of the whole globe and secured through a dozen layers of encryption. I asked him for a favour and spent half an hour trying to convince him. He finally gave in. This favour would have to be paid, and the cost would be huge.

She rose and moved to the window, but she wasn't hopeful. She'd stopped counting how many months she'd been here, or even how many knights had come to try and save her. But it wasn't a knight that rolled over the bridge today, it was a carriage led by a pair of fine, dark horses. She watched it curiously until it was too close to be seen over the castle walls.<br><br>She went back to the bench and perched on the edge, collecting her hair and drawing it over shoulder to make herself more presentable. She sat with her hands folded in her lap, waiting and listening. It didn't take long for the din of the dragon's roaring to start. This time, however, it lasted significantly longer than usual, finally finished by one last great roar that shook the stone walls and sent dust scattering down around her. Her brow creased, but still she tried to avoid being hopeful. After all, it hadn't done her any good yet.<br><br>And yet mere minutes later she heard footfalls in the hallway, and one of the doors down the way creaked open. Her heart was pounding in her chest as she waited. Was it finally over? Had some brave knight finally defeated the dragon? Would she finally be going hope? After much anticipation the door slowly creaked open, but it was not a knight that stood there.<br><br>\"Found her.\" In the doorway stood an armour-clad skeleton with pale blue eyes glittering in the sockets of its skull. She stared at it, uncertain if this was reality or perhaps another strange dream. Maybe she was so lonely she'd gone mad and was imagining all of this. The skeleton slowly stepped towards her and extended a gloved hand, and she recoiled.<br><br>\"Come.\" said the skeleton in a rasping voice. It grabbed her arm and pulled her to her feet, leading her out of the room and down the hall. Present were more skeletons in myriad suits of armour, like knights from all different kingdoms. They all had the same pale eyes, and they followed her and her escort down the stairs to the heart of the ruined keep. There waited a host of the armoured undead, the slain dragon, and a tall figure in a dark robe.<br><br>\"Ah, yes, there she is.\" The figure bowed gracefully to her. Ambiguous and anonymous, their features were completely hidden by dark cloth and metal. They were tall and spare, clutching a long staff topped with a pale blue crystal at their side.<br><br>\"W-who are you?\" said the Princess warily.<br><br>\"Do pardon me. I am under the employ of your father the King.\" The tall figure stepped towards her. \"I have been sent to fetch you.\"<br><br>\"N-no, that's not possible. You... you are a necromancer.\" she said. \"Father would never ask for help from someone like you.\"<br><br>\"Hm. Perhaps you do not know him as well as you'd think.\" The necromancer's voice was soft and calm, and still she couldn't tell if they were a man or a woman. \"His previous knights were allowed a degree of redemption in felling this beast. I am certain he will... appreciate that as well.\" The necromancer turned to the fallen dragon, stomach and throat pierced by spears and arrows.<br><br>\"Sending knights one at a time to fell a dragon. How... trite.\" said the necromancer. \"Collect what I desire and we shall be off, good knights.\" Three of the knights went to the dragon's body, hefting axes and swords.<br><br>\"What are you going to do?\"<br><br>\"A dragon offers many useful things. Scales, blood, fangs.\" said the necromancer. \"I confess I accepted this deal for those, but I suppose virtue, and the bundle of gold your father has waiting for me, are their own rewards.\"<br><br>\"S-so we are going home?\"<br><br>\"Of course, silly girl. What need have I for a Princess?\" The necromancer chuckled. \"For once someone is worth more to me alive than dead. What an intriguing turn of events this has been. Come, good knights, let us away.\" The knight released the princess' arm and the necromancer offered her a hand, and he - at least she assumed he was a he - led her out to the carriage as the knights remaining set on the dragon. She tried not to think about that as they set off down the road. Once inside the carriage, she moved close to the door and folded her hands between her legs. The necromancer sat in silence, resting his staff across his lap. He rapped a gloved knuckle on the window and a knight's face appeared.<br><br>\"Bring the goods to the palace once you are finished.\" said the necromancer. The knight nodded and disappeared, and the carriage started off. The necromancer tugged off a glove and raised the hand to his face to lower the hood and remove the veil that obscured his features.<br><br>\"Ah, much better. Do pardon the secrecy of it all, one can never take too many chances.\" The necromancer was not a he, but a she, a middle-aged woman with greying hair and kindly eyes. She smiled at the Princess' surprise.<br><br>\"What?

As for<br>the rest, there are a couple things involved. First, people's thoughts<br>are often jumbled and incoherent, especially when they're scared.<br>Second, many people think crazy stuff all the time; have you ever held a<br>knife and suddenly realized you could kill the people standing around<br>you? You'd never do it though, would you? Those intrusive thoughts<br>just pop into your head. Well, they'll pop into your kids' heads too.<br>Sometimes you won't be able to tell whose head the idea is in. Third,<br>even when it's clearly something that's not intrusive, many parents just<br>can't believe that it's something their kid is really thinking. Lee<br>Harvey Oswald's mother insisted for her entire life that he was<br>innocent. And there's a fourth reason, too. I'll let your parents explain that.\"<br><br>After the nurse left, my father<br>fixed me with an icy glare, and spoke slowly and carefully so there<br>would be no misunderstanding, \"Because you *must keep the secret*. If<br>you are ever seen to use knowledge that can only be gotten by reading<br>your child's mind, and reveal the secret, you and your family will be<br>eliminated. You *must* keep the knowledge from non-parents. That has<br>been the way of it since before the start of recorded history. It<br>doesn't matter if you find out your child is going to set off a nuke in<br>a crowded city, or give smallpox to a billion people, or is a serial<br>killer. Before you report it, you *must* to find a way to make it<br>seem you found out via mundane methods. If you can't do that, you keep<br>silent.\" My mother, with a look of terror in her eyes, just nodded.<br><br>My wife and I looked at them with disbelief.<br>My father continued, \"You know<br>how sometimes a mass murderer will kill his parents before he goes on<br>his rampage? Not all of those parents died at his hands. Some called<br>the police and reported that the killing was about to start, and so they were<br>killed for spilling the secret, and the massacre was allowed to continue<br>so it would be easy to cover up the killing of the parents. If you're<br>ever about to talk to someone about secret knowledge - law enforcement<br>especially, but really anyone - ask if they're a parent first. If they<br>aren't, keep your mouth shut. This may cost you some friendships with<br>your companions who haven't had kids yet, of course, because it's tricky<br>to self-censor all the time. But you've probably experienced that<br>before, as your friends had kids and then started hanging out with<br>parents, right? Maybe now you can reconnect with them a little.<br>You know the secret.\"<br><br>My mother looked very sad, and only nodded. My father took her hand,<br>and said \"I don't know if you're thinking about telling anyone; I can't tell that anymore. But if you are, *don't*. You *must* keep the secret.\" Then he<br>said \"Breaking the link is always exhausting. We'll go sit down in the waiting room for a few minutes.\"<br><br>Our daughter fell asleep, and the noise in my head calmed down a little.<br>I looked over at my wife, and she smiled at me. \"Did you believe all<br>that?\" she asked. \"I'm not sure,\" I said. \"Everybody on the planet<br>keeping such a huge secret for thousands of years doesn't seem likely.\"<br><br>\"No. I guess if they're just having a bit of fun with us, there's nothing<br>to tell. And if they're telling the truth, I guess we'll find out as<br>we go along. But either way, just to be on the safe side, maybe let's<br>keep this to ourselves, at least for now.

His brows furrowed as he said it, and he squinted his eyes as if in disbelief that I was reluctant to set foot in that horrifying, perverted excuse of a house. <br><br>I mean, *everyone* knows about 'the house'. <br><br>I'm talking about the pristine mansion perched precariously on the edge of the cliff, overlooking the sea. It stood there--like a silent observer--indifferent to the splashes and sloshes of the waves, to the shadows of the limestone formations cast upon the sand by the setting sun. The windows were so large that half the house seemed to be glass--and yet.. for all its paned, semi-transparent glory, I could not spy even *one* dark sinister figure staring back ominously at me, beckoning me to my doom. There was nothing, but the sheen and glare of the polished glass.<br><br>It was absolutely terrifying. <br><br>Ryan stepped up ahead, walking past the beautiful manicured garden and towards the door. I followed closely behind, not wanting to be left alone. <br><br>All the stories were true--I could feel it as we walked closer and closer to the front door. The plants, trees and vegetation--they were all.. thriving! Nothing resembled the usual dilapidated garden with overgrown grass and bare, leafless trees that look like creepy garden bogeymen! <br><br>I vomited in my mouth, but quickly swallowed it so Ryan wouldn't see. He walked bravely in front of me to the front door. He extended his hand to the gold-plated doorknob and looked at me smugly. The expertly carved wooden door was unblemished--no claw marks, scratches or caked blood stains. The sight caused me to vomit in my mouth again. It must have looked like I was gagging.<br><br>\"Dude are you choking? HAHA, *I'm* not even scared. You really are a pussy.\"<br><br>\"Oh yeah? Then why don't you just fucking go in already, you dick,\" I managed between episodes of vomiting.<br><br>He sneered, and twisted the doorknob in this hand. In one swift motion, Ryan flung the door open. No squeaking. No creaking. The door opened so smoothly and with such ease that he fell over flat on the floor, having overcompensated with too much force. It was almost as if the door wasn't bound by any sort of malevolent supernatural force at all. <br><br>Still shaking, I dared to look through the doorframe and into the hallway.

As far down the room as my eye could see, it was a repulsive abyss of tidy home decorating and immaculate construction. The paintings... there were *no* demonic paintings of faces that turn to watch you in the night. There were *no* haunting figures in the edge of my vision.. not even a decomposing corpse swinging on a rope with the noose around its neck eerily foreshadowing my impending grisly demise. But by far the worse part--the worst part was the deafening silence. Try as I may, I could not hear even a single ghostly whisper warning me to 'turn back'. There wasn't even one piercing scream from the damned souls of the underworld. Just the thick air of silence. <br><br>I had enough. I was a sweaty mess at the point, and I was pretty sure I peed my pants. Ryan was in front of me, still sprawled on the marbled floor of the mansion, staring into the hallway.

All across the scene I could see the twisted snakes of metal and wood. There was the drop tower, off to my right.

It was difficult to move, balanced there on a doubled 2x4, with nails sticking out all around his head, cob-web spiders scurrying along every vector, creating new universes in the strange geometry of the garage attic. This place had intrigued him as a teenager, sneaking up there on the old hand-made looking ladder to smoke weed after his parents had gone to bed. Legend had it; that building had existed before the house, and it had been a speak-easy during the prohibition era. There had been a bar with a hidden pocket wall in front of it that could be quickly drawn to hide the sink, mirrors, bar and kegs. There was even a beautiful 20ft long, 6inch thick oak shuffle-board surface that must weigh 3 tons. That space was filled with now filled with the detritus of his family, and they were looking to sell both buildings and move to the city for their retirement. For several weekends he had helped them sort through crap, hauling to the dump and Salvation Army with his pick-up truck. The garage attic was the last frontier of that effort, and the feeling was strange, emptiness of a childhood home nostalgia crossed with an adult sense of historic intrigue. It was filled with uninteresting crap - wood blinds, metal cabinets filled with wood-working resins, various pieces of broken furniture, old farm tools including an enormous reaper style scythe. <br>It had been decades since he had been up here last, and probably no one had been since. Much harder now as a 40-something year old to navigate the ceiling joists and dodge the nails with his head, like a boxer, bobbing and weaving. Most of the crap he unceremoniously tossed out the broken window in the eves, onto the flagstone patio below. Sweat stung his eyes and fluids dripped from his face. In the farthest back part was a pile that looked different from the rest - it was farther back than he had ever explored and he was fairly certain it was the origin of the wasps who besides himself and a possum, were the only ones left here, far back in the woods. He inched his way farther back, goosebumps on his sweat soaked sides and arms - feeling nervous, of what? - copperhead snakes in an attic? - Deadly spiders? - Falling thru the ceiling into the garage below? Determined, he reached the unidentified bundle in the nook of the chimney and the furthest wall. A pile of fabric, maybe an old curtain turned mouse nest shed petrified turds onto the ceiling below him. There was a child's rocking chair, thick lacquer preserving brightest indigo and turquoise paint, with intricate flower designs held two sweet looking dolls, cold, painted porcelain heads and bodies made from some kind of leather. One of the dolls had a crack across her cheek and a missing eye. \"Pick up your china doll - ..it's only fractured\" he hummed thru goobers. They were quite beautiful, and tho he had never had the slightest interest in dolls or antique anything (except silver, of course), he felt a powerful urge to take care of these. \"Ju-uust a little nervous from the fall.\" There was a sort of tray with gaudy bakelite jewelry and a mismatched teacup set, more decayed fabrics. He dusted off the chair with his hand, while cradling the dolls delicately. He arranged them in the chair the way a child might have a hundred years before, set the tea party appropriately. From several beams closer to where the roof met the ceiling, a pile of rags seemed to stir. The elongated abdomen of some exotic species of murder-hornet passed thru the beam of his flashlight and out the broken window. The feeling of tenderness turned to adrenaline and fear, the attic became a suffocating 100 degree death trap. Panicked, he straightened, taking a nail in the skull. Roaring in pain and fear he un-staked himself and awkwardly fumbled backwards, collecting more injuries from nails, almost stepping off the girders and thru the asbestos ceiling. Thru pain and sweat mixed with blood stinging his eyes as badly as the hornets who now swarmed around him stung his arm and neck, he somehow found his way back to the attic ladder. Still clutching the flashlight, miraculously, he chanced a blurred looked back from where he had nearly fixed his head to the roof, and there, where the pile of rags had harbored equatorial giant dragon wasps, a third, incredibly life like, small child sized doll appeared to smile at him lovingly. The macabre overtone was displaced by an otherworldly sense of peace, his panic and pain morphed into a surge of wellbeing, even as the ladder collapsed under his feet, his armpit socket finding a portruding handnail to suspend him from the opening.

The world started to spin. It was too much...<br><br>\u201cHere you go. Should have you up in no time\u2026\u201d<br><br>I slipped out from the world as if falling into a dream. Time lost all meaning and everything around me wavered in and out from reality, as if uncertain themselves whether or not they truly existed or were simply a fleeting memory. Sometimes I would awaken on the floor with that same horrible, wonderful stench in the air. My body quivering in anticipation. Other times I would be walking around the room as I woke, staring at rows upon rows of drawers set into the walls, tables scattered about or set into the wall. <br><br>\"What's your name?\"<br><br>All of it had the same sterile look of ungarnished metal, marred only by large blackened stains. Always the same smell\u2026 Blood\u2026 A horrid crimson blood like roses in twilight. The beautiful stench of life\u2019s memory. Life that would soon be mine. A part of myself. The more I lingered on the smell, the shorter the fits of clarity seemed to be.<br><br>\"Wake up, Mary. It's breakfast time!\"<br><br> Soon enough I would be swimming again, lost in some non-reality until I was finally able to find a bit of reality to stand upon once more. Minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years, decades, centuries. There was a seemingly endless amount of time in the middle where all I can remember wanting was to eventually find the end. This scent, this unreality, this horrible hunger...Pain and hunger... Food... Meat...<br><br><br>***<br><br>I woke lying on something hard. I was face down, looking over the edge of the whatever-it-was and down at the metal floor. There was a dark stain marring the otherwise uninteresting ground, bringing to mind the Rorschach tests where you would find shapes and scenes within blots of ink. This one was a sea urchin detonating, which no doubt would have led to extensive talks of how my childhood led to a favor of white wine over red, or other such nonsense.<br><br>I tried to move. Tried to prop myself more upright and get into a position where I could observe just where I was, but my arms were stiff. I could practically hear the groan of old gears trying to move, as if each joint were a rusted machine, long forgotten in some lost factory.. I must have been lying here for quite some time to have gotten this stiff. I turned my head, neck similarly stiff but more obedient. It was time to try and get bearings of just where I was\u2026<br><br>The room was quite dark, making it rather difficult to see anything too specific. The wall to my left was lined with rows and rows of square doors. I had seen something similar before but I couldn\u2019t quite remember from where\u2026 but they gave the impression of small refrigerators, neatly lined in a row. A few were slightly ajar, but none so much as to where I could see inside from this position. I seemed to be resting atop a large table of some sort, it just large enough for me to lie without hanging over the edges. A number of other similar tables were also in the room. A few had fallen onto their side to reveal wheels at the end of each leg.<br> <br>I started to push myself up, straining against my stubborn arms. There was a strange flowing in my body accompanied by my center of balance shifting. Were I not already lying it surely would have caused me to fall. There was something in me... As I were filled near the brim with water, my body shifted and flowed with an internal liquid. Having successfully maneuvered myself to my knees, I crossed my stiff arms across my stomach and leaned forward to wretch. There was no pain or feeling of sickness, but my body had a desperate urge to dispel this foreign presence. My eyes clamped shut, I could feel the sludge crawl up my throat and out my mouth. There was no taste, just the feeling of my body gradually growing lighter as it was emptied. Eventually, the sickness was fully expelled from my system, now an oily brown puddle that was slowly creeping out to cover this area of the floor.<br><br>I am not well.<br><br>I looked around to try and get a better grasp of my surroundings now that I had a more natural position in the room. It was fairly empty for such a large room, larger than any sort of residence meaning that this place must have been specifically made for some purpose rather than a reclaimed building or one that had been repurposed. There was a long table in the back that had various small metal instruments strewn about it, though from this position I couldn't tell the specifics on what they were. Apart from that, nothing else seemed to have been hiding behind me when I first awoke.<br><br>Something was wrong\u2026 the whole scene\u2026 nothing dramatically wrong but.. as if looking at a painting that had been set into a new frame I could feel that there was something a bit off with how I was seeing the world. However, compared to the other problems at hand, this visual abnormality seemed trivial at best, so I tucked it away for later examination. Looking to the sides, I could see that the various tables were in fact gurneys, there wheels readily visible now that I could see. There was something strikingly familiar about them, but again my mind only offered absences when I tried to remember\u2026 I could not remember much at all really, so this was hardly surprising. This was no time to panic over lost memories, and visual abnormalities. I need to survive this place and get a grip on where I am before I start panicking over anything else.<br><br>My vision wavered and my body started to grow unsteady. Now that I was recovering from the shock of vomiting, a deep tire made itself known throughout my body. Without any time to steady myself or shift, I felt myself falling towards the wall.

It wasn't the heavy, depressing rain that drained the colour out of everything, but the light rain that turns dirt to mud and gently floods parking lots and alleyways. Through the throngs of the crowd, I followed my target, always sure that he knew I was on his trail. And yet, never once did he duck down an alley or try to slip into a building. The man I followed was, and still is, considered a great hero. Perhaps the greatest this city has ever seen. Stories say that when he was still wet behind the ears that he stopped old Gumshoe within a week of his Turning. I hadn't been around then, but I heard it was a shame. Wasn't a crime Gumshoe couldn't see through. He didn't have any super powers that most people could consider relevant, but he could see things that occurred within ten feet of a person by touching them, alive or dead. It was handy for solving murders. But now, Gamble was getting close to his own Turning, and his retirement from super heroing into a life of villainy. I was here to stop him from getting there.<br><br>Finally, he turned into a place. No alley, just a cafe. I could wait around, give him some time. There weren't any screams inside or anything, so he hadn't Turned yet. I opted to follow him in. I was hit by the smell of cinnamon and pastries and high priced coffee. I checked my expenses, equal to one-tenth the bounty. I had enough to at least afford some creature comforts, so I indulged myself. I almost turned right into him. He was standing right behind me, finding myself looking up slightly to a peeved look.<br><br>\"I know you're following me.\" He accused. Well at least Gamble cut right to the meat. \"It won't happen to me. I know it. You know it. Everyone knows it.\" A bold face lie, betting on his super power to help tilt the odds. Can't say I blame him for trying though. <br><br>\"I am, but I'm not here to kill you either. Not yet, anyways.\" I replied, trying to keep cool. Admittedly, it was hard. He could turn any second and I was not the kind of bounty hunter that specialized in close range. My skills were more... time based. \"Really, I just wanted to keep tabs on you. I don't like killing heroes. That's why I wait until they're villains.\" Usually, I added to myself.<br><br>It didn't look like my friend was buying it. Not that he was actually a friend of mine, of course. \"Would you like me to buy you a drink or something? No, probably best I don't, actually.\" I asked, then answered myself, reaching into my pockets. I had a pill in there, thumbed it open and rolled my fingers in the powder within. I still looked a little panicked, and I admit that I was, but I got saved by the fact Gamble still hadn't Turned and my order came up. Thanks to the close quarters, it was easy to make excuses for bumping my arm and hand into his. I wonder if he noticed anything extra about it. But I didn't get laid out, so all for the best.<br><br>I took a table out of sight of him, for the most part, reaching into my other pocket for the antidote of choice, swirling it into my drink, and then disposing of that. I dusted off my hand with the napkin and tossed it too. The rest of my stay was casual. I drank coffee, checked the news on my phone, ate my muffin. I left with not another word and Gamble's eyes burning into my head. That aside, the night was quiet. The next day I showed up to my employer's with Gamble's dice necklace. A signature item, if tacky. The news had it running too. Gamble had collapsed, suffering some sort of heart issue late last night. He seemed feverish and mad.

But this John is not concerned by such things; John is such a common name, after all. He has a job which he is paid to do, and he does it as dutifully as expected by Management. Day in, and Day out, he goes to work, does his job, and returns home, without complaint.<br><br>So, there he sats, at his desk, doing his job, as another company memo is dropped on his desk by a passing coworker. **\"Attention Block-C Associates\"** read the bold header, \"Break Hours for Associates working on the Hundale Renovations have been reduced to one quarter-hour, from two quarter-hours. (15 Minutes, Formerly 30 Minutes).\"* John glanced up at today's work directive, pinned to his cubicle wall, *\"Block-C Associates: Hundale Renovations | Duration: 3 Weeks (168 Working-Hours)\"*<br><br>Surely he thought that this must be illegal. But John did not think any such thing, for John truly was the model worker. He merely sighed, for he had planned to visit the slightly further coffee-shop on today's break, and would no longer have the time to do so. With that disappointment in mind, John dutifully returned to his work, of writing up similarly disappointing company memos regarding the status of the Renovation of Hundale Park Residence Block. The recent reports had indicated a stunning lack of progress, due in part to the fact that the construction workers were often pulled aside by Management Associates to write reports on their lack of progress.<br><br>*\"Clearly\"*, thought John, *\"If the construction workers were really doing their Job, Management wouldn't have to ask them to write so many reports.\"* Why, if this were to continue, John might have to suggest that the Company dissolve the contract, but would place the renovation efforts under City labour regulations, and the Company *certainly* could not afford that. And with that in mind, John pushes the thought out of his mind. Besides, it was the job of Management to make any such recommendation, and John did not want to draw undue attention to himself by going behind their backs.<br><br>Halfway though another dull paragraph of report-summary, John heard a coworker arguing with Block-C's Floor Manager; likely something about the slashing of break-'hours'. John preferred not to get involved in such things; after all, he was on track to a promotion any week now. Management constantly told him so, and surely they would never lie. *\"You can't do this to us, Sir! We're already working at reduced-break!\"* said the Coworker. *\"It's from over my head John, I can't do anything.\"* says the Floor Manager. The Coworker, clearly also named John, is silent for several seconds, perhaps making some physical attempt on the Floor Manager. Disappointingly, the Coworker John responds eventually, *\"I know you can talk to them, at least! You know the conditions down here, and you're with Management!\"*.<br><br>The manager does not respond, merely shaking his head and walking away. Not as though John, ever the model worker, in his Cubicle, could have seen or noticed. He was already writing a new Report, entitled in bold, **\"Block-C Disturbance Report\"**.

The first time he had seen an Armajian child running around with 3 orbs of what looked like fire Jim had been intrigued by the strange and enigmatic people.
